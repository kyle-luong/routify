          <h2>Why Routify?</h2>
          <p>
            As previous first-years ourselves, we know the confusion of navigating a huge new campus all too well. 
            We also know that just because your schedule works online, it doesn't always work in-person. Whether you're a
            new student or someone just looking to shave off some time from their schedule, Routify has the answer.
